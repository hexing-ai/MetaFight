/**
 * The commentator, made out of filters.
 *
 * Not the browser's speech synthesis: that sounds like a phone assistant, it
 * differs per machine, and half the point of a game that draws its own pixels
 * and plays its own music is that it makes its own noises too. This is formant
 * synthesis, which is roughly what the speech chips of the era did - a buzzing
 * source through a few sharp resonances, and the resonances are the vowel.
 *
 * A voiced sound is a sawtooth at about a hundred hertz through three bandpass
 * filters. Where those three filters sit is the difference between "ee" and
 * "ah"; sliding them from one place to another is a diphthong or a glide. An
 * unvoiced sound is noise through one filter, and a plosive is a moment of
 * silence followed by a click.
 *
 * It will never be mistaken for a person, which is the idea. Keep the phrases
 * short: two or three words read clearly, a sentence turns to mush.
 *
 * Shared verbatim with websoccer, webtennis and webtrack: the words live in a
 * separate file per game - here that is commentary.js, which is where the
 * announcer's vocabulary lives - and this file has no opinion about any of them.
 * It is given phonemes and it says them.
